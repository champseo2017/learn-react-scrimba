/* 
 One LAST time in this course, set up a React app from scratch
 Render an <App /> component
   App should be in its own file
App should render 5 <Joke /> components
   Each Joke should receive a "question" prop and a "punchLine" prop
   and render those however you'd like
  
EXTRA CREDIT:
Some jokes are only a punch line with no question:
E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only show the punchline instead?

Spend time practicing the style of your Joke component
